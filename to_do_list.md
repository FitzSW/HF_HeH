# To Do List

A short file to keep track of small tasks that pop up.

###  Choose whether CH4 or HeH, H2

#### Choose appropriate basis set to go with it

Then, after this redo the pyscf comparison

### Find out how to import modules from file to file (Fortran)

### Make either class or struct objects to represent basis functions (and primitives)

These should have atom name, atom location (center of function), length of
contraction, coefficients, exponents, list of angular momentum values (x, y,
or z for each). Make use of overlaps that we know beforehand are zero (eg an s
with a px on the same atom).
