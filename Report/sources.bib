abstract = {Python-based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a
	general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up
		to emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method
		development and enable flexible computational workflows. The package
		provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size
		systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions,
	low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using
		mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis
		functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python
		language to implement almost all of its features, while
		computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized
		C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package
		is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum
		chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and
		design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package. WIREs

abstract = {An efficient integral library Libcint was designed to
	automatically implement general integrals for Gaussian-type scalar and
		spinor basis functions. The library is able to evaluate arbitrary
		integral expressions on top of p, r and σ operators with one-electron
		overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt
		operators for segmented contracted and/or generated contracted basis
		in Cartesian, spherical or spinor form. Using a symbolic algebra tool,
	new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The
		generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular
		properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we
		computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both
		nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree–Fock level in
		this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge
		including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and
		shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the
		fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of
		the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the
		modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall
		throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node,
	we are able to achieve an average output 8.3 GB/s for C60 molecule with
		cc-pVTZ basis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
